# ðŸ“˜ My Storybook Template

> _Simple folder setup for React/Redux development_

Includes examples of a variety of things:

- Tests
- React
- Redux
- Workers
- Storybook
- TypeScript

This is my `create-react-app` template for just playing around!

See the [master branch](https://github.com/beccasaurus/my-storybook) for a flat directory (not using `create-react-app`)
